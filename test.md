Here is a proposal that creates something usable week 1 and culminates into an enterprise solution by week 30.

Milestone 1 - Immediate AI Access ($20K)                                                                                                                                        
  - Terminal access for you, Jake, and designated team within 48hrs of approval                       
  - Infrastructure setup + role/task/tool definitions for repeatable AI workflows                     
  - Weekly hands-on training sessions                                                                 
  - Uses existing Astute remote desktop                                                               
                                                                                                      
  Infrastructure: $400/mo ($200 bare-metal server + $200 Claude Pro Max)                              
                                                                                                      
Milestone 2 - Enterprise Rollout ($76K / 6 months budget)                                           
                                                                                                      
  - AI integration across all systems with API/integration points (Salesforce, Calcuquote, Infor, IHS, etc)                                 
  - Extends Milestone 1 to every role and tool at Astute                                              
  - Weekly progress summaries; no contract, so you can determine if we are producing the value you expect at any point                         
  - Invoiced on actuals, not budget                                                                   
                                                                                                     
Milestone 1 proves it works. Milestone 2 makes it scale. The real ROI comes when AI isn't a tool for a few people, it's embedded in how the entire company operates. Let's nail Milestone 1, then discuss enterprise rollout based on what we learn. This pricing includes our implmentation hours will be submitted in weekly timesheets for your review. Please let's discuss any questions, I think we all have a mutual goal here.
