Here is a proposal that creates something usable week 1 and culminates in an enterprise solution by week 30.

Milestone 1 - Immediate AI Access ($20K)                                                                                                                                        
  - Terminal access for you, Jake, and designated team within 48hrs of approval                       
  - Infrastructure setup + role/task/tool definitions for repeatable AI workflows                     
  - Weekly hands-on training sessions                                                                 
  - Uses existing Astute remote desktop                                                               
                                                                                                      
  Infrastructure: $400/mo ($200 bare-metal server + $200 Claude Pro Max)                              
                                                                                                      
  Milestone 2 - Enterprise Rollout ($76K / 6 months budget)                                           
                                                                                                      
  - AI integration across all systems with API/integration points                                     
  - Extends Milestone 1 to every role and tool at Astute                                              
  - Weekly progress summaries; no contract lock-in—you control the pace                               
  - Invoiced on actuals, not budget                                                                   
                                                                                                     
Milestone 1 proves it works. Milestone 2 makes it scale. The real ROI comes when AI isn't a tool for a few people—it's embedded in how the entire company operates. Let's nail Milestone 1, then discuss enterprise rollout based on what we learn.
