Colm,

Phase 1 - Immediate access ($400/month)
Gets you and Jake raw terminal access to Claude + data (plus anyone else you wish to initially entrust)
Uses existing Astute remote desktop
Will need you to provide access to desired data sources (Ie Salesforce API keys or database access)
$400/month
$200 Phoenix Nap Bare-metal server
$200 Claude Pro Max Subscription
Completed within 24hrs of your approval to proceed

Phase 2 - Full enterprise implementation ($96K/6mo)
Building the guiderails and security towards enabling company-wide use
$4000/week budget for implementation hours and costs that you reserve the right shutdown at any point based on your assessment of deliverable output

Phase 1 gives you immediate access to what you've already seen is possible; phase 2 allows us to realize the vision across the entire enterprise with every system and every user. It's my recommendation that we implement phase I and reassess after 3 weeks to determine if this is worthy of an enterprise discussion
